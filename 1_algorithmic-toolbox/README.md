# Algorithmic Toolbox
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duliodenis/ucsd-algorithms/master/art/Algo-Toolbox.png)

This course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. We will learn a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).

The course session is 5 Weeks of Study with Problem Sets assigned weekly:
