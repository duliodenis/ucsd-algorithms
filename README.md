# UCSD Algorithms
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duliodenis/ucsd-algorithms/master/art/Specialization-Header.png)

This repository is a collection of my solutions to the problem sets in the University of California, San Diego, Data Structures &amp; Algorithms Specialization. These solutions are meant as a way to share both my logic and thinking as well as to solicit feedback from members of the community.

The Specialization covers algorithmic techniques for solving problems arising in computer science applications. It is a mix of theory and practice where not only do we design algorithms and estimate their complexity, but we get a deeper understanding of algorithms by implementing them in C++.

The five courses in the Specialization are:

Course  | Name
------------- | -------------
1. | [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://github.com/duliodenis/ucsd-algorithms/tree/master/1_algorithmic-toolbox)
2. | Data Structures
3. | Algorithms on Graphs and Trees
4. | Algorithms on Strings
5. | Advanced Algorithms and Complexity
