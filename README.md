# UCSD Algorithms
![](art/Specialization-Header.png?raw=true)

This repository is a collection of the problem sets and starter files in the University of California, San Diego, Data Structures &amp; Algorithms Specialization. My submitted solutions to these problem sets are in a private repo due to the University's Code of Honor.

The Specialization covers algorithmic techniques for solving problems arising in computer science applications. It is a mix of theory and practice where not only do we design algorithms and estimate their complexity, but we get a deeper understanding of algorithms by implementing them in C++.

The five courses, and Capstone project, in the Specialization are:

Course  | Name
------------- | -------------
1. | [Algorithmic Toolbox](1_algorithmic-toolbox)
2. | [Data Structures](2_data-structures)
3. | Algorithms on Graphs and Trees
4. | Algorithms on Strings
5. | Advanced Algorithms and Complexity
6. | Shortest Path Capstone
